# Frontend Mentor - Typing Speed Test

![Design preview for the Typing Speed Test coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this typing speed test app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We store the passage data in a local `data.json` file. You can use that to randomly select passages of varying difficulty.

Your users should be able to:

#### Test Controls

- Start a test by clicking the start button or by clicking the passage and typing
- Select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) for passages of varying complexity
- Switch between "Timed (60s)" mode and "Passage" mode (timer counts up, no limit)
- Restart at any time to get a new random passage from the selected difficulty

#### Typing Experience

- See real-time WPM, accuracy, and time stats while typing
- See visual feedback showing correct characters (green), errors (red/underlined), and cursor position
- Correct mistakes with backspace (original errors still count against accuracy)

#### Results & Progress

- View results showing WPM, accuracy, and characters (correct/incorrect) after completing a test
- See a "Baseline Established!" message on their first test, setting their personal best
- See a "High Score Smashed!" celebration with confetti when beating their personal best
- Have their personal best persist across sessions via localStorage

#### UI & Responsiveness

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements

### Data Model

A `data.json` file is provided with passages organized by difficulty. Each passage has the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "easy-1",
  "text": "The sun rose over the quiet town. Birds sang in the trees as people woke up and started their day."
}
```

| Property | Type   | Description                                                               |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`     | string | Unique identifier for the passage (e.g., "easy-1", "medium-3", "hard-10") |
| `text`   | string | The passage text the user will type                                       |

### Expected Behaviors

- **Starting the test**: The timer begins when the user starts typing or clicks the start button. Clicking directly on the passage text and typing also initiates the test
- **Timed mode**: 60-second countdown. Test ends when timer reaches 0 or passage is completed
- **Passage mode**: Timer counts up with no limit. Test ends when the full passage is typed
- **Error handling**: Incorrect characters are highlighted in red with an underline. Backspace allows corrections, but errors still count against accuracy
- **Results logic**:
  - First completed test: "Baseline Established!" - sets initial personal best
  - New personal best: "High Score Smashed!" with confetti animation
  - Normal completion: "Test Complete!" with encouragement message

### Data Persistence

The personal best score should persist across browser sessions using `localStorage`. When a user beats their high score, the new value should be saved and displayed on subsequent visits.
 
 


 Core requirements:

-[x] Start a test by clicking Start or just typing
-[x] Choose difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and mode (Timed 60s or Passage)
-[x] See real-time WPM, accuracy, and time while typing
-[x] Get visual feedback: correct characters in green, errors in red/underlined, with a visible cursor
-[x] Backspace to fix mistakes (original errors still count against accuracy)
-[x] View results after each test with WPM, accuracy, and character counts
-[x] Track personal bests with localStorage – celebrate when you beat your high score
-[x] Responsive layout with proper hover and focus states

 Ideas to push further:
-[x] Historical tracking of your WPM and accuracy over time
-[x] Shareable result cards for social media
-[x] Multiple test durations (15s, 30s, 60s, 120s)
-[x] Different text categories: quotes, lyrics, code snippets
-[x] Add sounds
-[] A keyboard heatmap showing where you make mistakes
